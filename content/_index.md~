# Through the years

The Everglades were once more than double their current size. For thousands of years, this expansive “river of grass” swelled with summer rains, fed by Lake Okeechobee. In the 1800s, settlers built canals, dikes, and levees to drain the northern Everglades for agriculture. Communities and thousands of acres of farmland sprang up in the fertile soil south of the lake, in places that once naturally flooded.

These developments, however, subjected these settlements to catastrophic flooding. Two hurricanes in the 1920s killed thousands of people. In the 1930s, Congress built the Herbert Hoover Dike across the southern end of Lake Okeechobee and put the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in charge of protecting these settlements from disastrous floods. When the lake overflowed, the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie Canals sent the water to the east and west coasts. 

The Everglades were cut off from the life-giving water of Lake Okeechobee, which had sustained a diverse array of freshwater, brackish, and saltwater communities that included alligators, crocodiles, and manatees. More than 70 percent of the water that flowed through the Everglades was lost to tide or irrigation. In the 1940s, the remaining Everglades were consumed by wildfire, and, after a 1947 hurricane caused flooding throughout the state, the Everglades National Park was established to protect the remaining wetlands.

In 1948, Congress authorized the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project, which put in the hands of the Army Corps of Engineers one of the largest and most complex water management systems in the world, including thousands of miles of canals and levees as well as hundreds of other water control structures. It also set aside hundreds of thousands of acres south of Lake Okeechobee that were already privately owned and under cultivation as formally designated farmland, called the Everglades Agricultural Area, or EAA. Today, this area is largely farmed by the sugar industry. By 1950, South Floridians had inherited a water management problem and entrenched the infrastructure causing it.

Since then, federal, state, tribal, and local governments have been working to reverse these ill-considered, century-old water management decisions, while protecting everyone from flooding and balancing the needs of many different constituents. In 2000, the state and federal government collaborated on the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), which laid out a program for restoring the southward flow of the water from Lake Okeechobee. Since then, 33  components of the plan, as well as dozens of state projects, have been built to progress toward this goal. The biggest leap forward yet, the EAA reservoir, was authorized in 2018 and 2020 and is now under construction south of Lake Okeechobee, on the border between the sugar farmlands of the EAA and state wildlife management areas north of Everglades National Park.
