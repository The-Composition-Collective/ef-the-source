    <p>From the colorful, art-filled streets of Miami to the Gulf-side beaches of Naples and Sanibel Island, from Lake Okeechobee to the Florida Keys, South Florida shares one thing in common: water. Headwaters of the Kissimmee River near Orlando flow to Lake Okeechobee, which provides water to the southern part of the state. But infrastructure development has disrupted the water’s natural flow southward. The peninsula’s systemic problem with water has worsened over the past century. Alliances between federal, state, tribal and local governments have begun to reverse the damage, fighting against the tide of population growth and environmental change. The big missing piece of the puzzle is now under construction: the EAA Reservoir.</p>

    <p>The Everglades has sustained—and challenged—Florida for generations. For thousands of years, this expansive “river of grass” swelled with summer rains, fed by Lake Okeechobee. In the 1800s, settlers built canals, dikes, and levees to drain the northern Everglades for agriculture. Communities and thousands of acres of farmland sprang up in the fertile soil south of the lake, in places that once naturally flooded. </p>
    <p>These developments, however, subjected these settlements to catastrophic flooding. Two hurricanes in the 1920s killed thousands of people. In the 1930s, Congress built the Herbert Hoover Dike across the southern end of Lake Okeechobee and put the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in charge of protecting these settlements from disastrous floods. When the lake overflowed, the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie Canals sent the water to the east and west coasts. </p>
    <p>The Everglades were cut off from the life-giving water of Lake Okeechobee, which had sustained a diverse array of freshwater, brackish, and saltwater communities that included alligators, crocodiles, and manatees. The Everglades now cover half the area they once did. More than 70 percent of the water that flowed through the Everglades is lost to tide or irrigation. In the 1940s, the parched Everglades burned, and, after a 1947 hurricane caused flooding throughout the state, the Everglades National Park was established to protect the remaining wetlands.  </p>
    <p>In 1948, Congress put the Army Corps of Engineers in charge of one of the largest and most complex water management systems in the world, including thousands of miles of canals and levees as well as hundreds of other water control structures, by forming the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project. This legislation also set aside hundreds of thousands of acres south of Lake Okeechobee that were already privately owned and under cultivation as formally designated farmland, called the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA). Today, this area is largely farmed by the sugar industry. By 1950, South Floridians had inherited a water management problem and entrenched the infrastructure causing it.</p>
    <p>Since then, federal, state, tribal, and local governments have been working to reverse these ill-considered, century-old water management decisions, while protecting everyone from flooding and balancing the needs of many different constituents. In 2000, the state and federal government laid out a multi-billion-dollar program for restoring the southward flow of the water from Lake Okeechobee, called the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP). Since then, 33 components of the plan, as well as dozens of state projects, have been built to progress toward this goal. The biggest leap forward yet, the EAA reservoir, is now under construction south of Lake Okeechobee, on the border between the sugar farmlands of the EAA and state wildlife management areas north of Everglades National Park.</p>

    <p>Draining the Everglades has repercussions far beyond its borders, because it supplies vital water to so many downstream habitats and communities. One out of three residents in South Florida get their drinking water from the Everglades. Millions of residents and tourists use 3 billion gallons of water per day, supplied by an underground river below the Everglades. This groundwater is stored in aquifers, mainly the Biscayne Aquifer, which supplies drinking water to Miami, Palm Beach, and surrounding counties. </p>
    <p>The Biscayne Aquifer’s freshwater levels are drawn down by a growing population, increasing tourism, and sea level rise on the one hand, and reduced input from the Everglades on the other hand. A 2021 report by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection predicted that the state’s current water supply could not meet the growing needs of residents without new interventions. </p>
    <p>Not only is Miami-Dade County Florida’s most populous, but also its iconic beaches and proximity to national parks make it a tourism hotspot. Tourism in this county alone contributed about $30 billion to the Florida economy in 2024. The EAA Reservoir will double the amount of freshwater that CERP projects send to the Everglades, for an estimated total of 120 billion gallons every year. Restoring the natural flow of water through the Everglades isn’t just an ecological fix—it’s a lifeline for the drinking water supply in Miami.</p>

    <p>The goal of the EAA Reservoir is to store excess water from Lake Okeechobee that would otherwise be lost to the east and west, and instead clean it and send it south to the Everglades, Biscayne Aquifer and Florida Bay. The reservoir has two parts: a wetland and a big above-ground earthen pool. The pool—the reservoir itself—will hold 260,000 acre feet of water and cover 10,000 acres, surrounded by 31-foot-high earthen berms. The adjacent wetland, STA A-2, will cover 6,000 acres. More than 100 Disney World Magic Kingdom theme parks could fit across the surface of these two parts; they cover the area of a medium-sized city like Sarasota, FL. Building them will cost about $4 billion, funded collaboratively by the state and federal governments.</p>
    <p>The EAA reservoir will fit within the larger strategy of Everglades restoration that has been progressing since 2000. “Lake Okeechobee is the heart of the system,” says Major Cory Bell, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ deputy district commander in South Florida. “EAA and the reservoirs north, south, east, and west of Lake Okeechobee move excess water during hurricanes and major rain events out of the lake and store it. Once it’s stored, it can be treated, allowing clean, fresh water to go through the Everglades and into Florida Bay.”</p>
    <p>Unlike the other reservoirs around Lake O, though, the EAA is huge—it can store at least 10 times as much water. That’s enough water to lower Lake O by one footCK and give Everglades Restoration a massive boost. </p>
    <p>The EAA reservoir will tap into two existing canals between Lake O and the Everglades: the Miami Canal and the North New River Canal. The canals connect Lake O with waterways in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, respectively. In the newly built system, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers can send more water through those canals to the EAA reservoir, where it will then flow through the stormwater treatment wetland to clean out the fertilizer and sediment runoff, and then flow out the Miami Canal. [ADD INFO ABOUT UNDERGROUND DAM TO MAKE SURE WATER GETS TO THE AQUIFER—STEVE INTERVIEW]  </p>
    <p>The South Florida Water Management District predicts that once the EAA reservoir is operational, 120 billion gallons of water will flow to the Everglades and Florida Bay each year and the discharges from Lake O to the east and west that cause harmful algae blooms will be reduced by 55 percent.</p>

    <p>The main problematic pollutants from Lake O are nutrients found in fertilizers, most especially phosphorus. By the time the water reaches the EAA reservoir, it has traveled from the urban developments in and around Orlando through cattle and sugar farmlands. It’s full of nutrient and sediment runoff. [QUOTE FROM STEVE ABOUT BLACK MAYONNAISE?] That runoff can cause harmful algae blooms off the east and west coasts of Florida. Before it can be sent south to the Everglades, the water must meet a standard of cleanliness of NUMBERTK. </p>
    <p>The stormwater treatment areas, called STAs, are wetlands that perform this massive cleaning function, and plants are the cleanup crew. In an STA wetland, the plants that first meet the eye are ones that stick up out of the water, like cattails, bulrushes, and other wetland grasses. These plants slow down the water, allowing sediment to drop out of the current, and they take a solid pass at nutrient uptake. But the real workhorses of the cleanup crew are hidden underwater: aquatic plants and algae like muskgrass and native naiads. This vegetation, along with the microbes on and around them, take up the lion’s share of the phosphorus and other excess nutrients in the STA. </p>
    <p>Wetland restoration biologists from the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) plant this vegetation in the STAs, strategically putting the cattails and bulrushes in places to slow the water, while cultivating the underwater plants near the outputs to ensure the cleanest water possible enters the Everglades. Planting began in the 6,000-acre STA wetland adjacent to the EAA reservoir in spring 2025, and wading birds and alligators have already moved in.</p>
