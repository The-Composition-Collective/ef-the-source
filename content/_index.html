    <p>From the mural-lined streets of Miami to the shell-strewn beaches of Sanibel Island, from the expanse of Lake Okeechobee to the coral cays of the Florida Keys, South Florida is bound together by water. For millennia, the Kissimmee River carried rain into Lake Okeechobee, feeding the Everglades and the coastlines beyond. However, decades of infrastructure development cut off that natural flow southward, harming Florida’s natural ecosystem, economy and coastal communities. Over the past 25 years, federal, state, tribal and local governments have worked to reverse the damage, fighting against the tide of population growth and environmental change. The largest missing piece of the puzzle is now underway: the EAA reservoir.</p>

    <h1 class="title">Through the Years</h1>
    <p class="subhead">The Everglades' current state is a result of past infrastructure issues, flooding and fires. These past events can provide valuable insights for future restoration.</p>
    <p>In the 19th century, large sections of the Everglades were drained for agriculture with canals, levees and dams being built. These changes reduced the Everglades to half its original size and led to catastrophic flooding. </p>
    <p>To control future floods in the 1930s, engineers built the Herbert Hoover Dike near Clewiston along Lake Okeechobee’s southern edge, redirecting overflow to the east and west coasts through the St. Lucie and Caloosahatchee rivers.</p>
    <p>Over time, more than 70 percent of the water that once flowed through the Everglades was lost to tide or irrigation, leading to wildfires and severe flooding. The federal government established Everglades National Park and launched the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project in the 1940s. This initiative introduced a coordinated approach to water management, overseeing thousands of miles of canals and levees, while designating farmland south of Lake Okeechobee as the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA). By 1950, South Florida faced a deepening water-management crisis — worsened by the very infrastructure meant to solve it.</p>

    <h1 class="title">Into the current</h1>
    <p class="subhead">Past water management decisions of the past linger today; threatening Florida’s overall ecosystem, economy and drinking water supply.</p>
    <p>As the water moves east and west, it isn’t flowing naturally south to replenish Florida’s water supply. One in three South Floridians depends on the Everglades for drinking water. Residents and visitors consume about 3 billion gallons daily, drawn from an underground river beneath the Everglades. This water is stored in aquifers, primarily the Biscayne Aquifer, which supplies drinking water to Miami, Palm Beach and surrounding areas. As demand is rising with a growing population, booming tourism and rising seas, the supply is shrinking. </p>
    <p>A 2021 Florida Department of Environmental Protection report warned that the state’s water supply will fail to meet future needs without action. Beyond drinking water, freshwater flow is also essential to balancing Florida Bay’s salinity. When salinity levels rise too high, wildlife dies and the fishing industry suffers.</p>
    <p>These water challenges become financial challenges, as Florida’s economy and tax revenues are inextricably tied to the natural ecosystem.  Miami-Dade’s tourism industry alone contributed $30 billion in economic impact in 2023. Tourism and real-estate also play an outsized role in tax revenues. Tourism accounts for 15 percent of Florida’s tax revenue and reduces the individual Floridians’ tax burden by an average $1900 a year. </p>
    <p>In recent decades, policymakers and scientists have recognized that short-term fixes are insufficient. In 2000, state and federal leaders launched the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), a multi-billion-dollar initiative to restore natural water flow south from Lake Okeechobee. Of its 68 planned projects, 33 have been completed, alongside dozens of state-led initiatives. The most ambitious project yet, the EAA Reservoir, began construction in 2021.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>“South Florida is a hotbed for population growth, and it’s all being supported by an abundant supply of fresh water. “And that future is in jeopardy because of the way we currently manage water.”</p>
      <p class="cite">Eric Eikenberg, CEO of The Everglades Foundation</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>“Small and medium-sized companies in the tourism economy are now coming to the table, telling elected officials in Washington and Tallahassee that Everglades Restoration must happen in order to preserve their lifestyles and livelihoods,” Eikenberg says.</p>

    <h1 class="title">Water in Reserve</h1>
    <p class="subhead">Funded through a $4 billion partnership between state and federal agencies, the EAA Reservoir represents a major investment in Florida’s clean water future.</p>
    <p>The EAA Reservoir full build includes a 10,500-acre above-ground reservoir, enclosed by 37-foot earthen embankment walls to store water from Lake Okeechobee, and an adjacent 6,500-acre wetland (STA A-2) that will filter pollutants. The reservoir will look like a vast, elevated lake, while the STA is a wetland, full of plants, birds and fish. Together, the reservoir and STA span an area larger than 150 Disney Magic Kingdoms or the size of Manhattan. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will oversee and build the EAA Reservoir, working with the state’s South Florida Water Management District, Seminole and Miccosukee governments and local communities.</p>
    <p> “Lake Okeechobee is the heart of the system,” says Major Cory Bell, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ deputy district commander in South Florida. “EAA and the reservoirs north, south, east, and west of Lake Okeechobee move excess water during hurricanes and major rain events out of the lake and store it.”</p>
    <p>The EAA Reservoir can store at least 10 times more water than other reservoirs — enough water to lower Lake Okeechobee by a half foot and give Everglades restoration a massive boost. The EAA Reservoir can double the amount of freshwater sent into the Everglades. </p>
    <p>But before the water can reach the EAA Reservoir, it passes through Orlando’s urban sprawl, cattle pastures and sugar farmlands, collecting sediment and nutrient runoff. Instead of sending this polluted, excess Lake Okeechobee water east and west, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will direct water from Lake Okeechobee into the reservoir, where it will be stored until the dry season. From there, the STA will filter the water before sending it south through Everglades National Park. </p>

    <h1 class="title">The power of plants</h1>
    <p class="subhead">Civil engineering and nature work together to remove water pollutants before sending it south through the Everglades.</p>
    <p>If polluted water flows south unchecked, the Everglades suffers. That’s why water entering protected Everglades areas must meet a state standard of cleanliness.  </p>
    <p>Phosphorus, a key fertilizer ingredient used in sugar farming, is the main pollutant. The state standard for phosphorus content in the water entering the Everglades is 10 parts per billion, a threshold to avoid harmful effects.</p>
    <p>“The lake water is opaque and dark-colored,” says Dr. Steve Davis, chief science officer at the Everglades Foundation. “It looks like the chocolate drink Yoo-hoo mixed with Coca-Cola.” That’s where the STAs come in — artificial wetlands designed to clean the water before it reaches the Everglades.</p>
    <p>“As the water enters the stormwater treatment areas, it gets gradually cleaner,” says Davis. “At the other end, it’s almost crystal clear.” </p>
    <p>Wetland plants are the clean-up crew. Cattails and bulrushes slow the water, allowing sediment to settle and absorbing excess nutrients. And under the water, even more aquatic plants and algae like muskgrass and native naiads filter out the pollutants. These plants, along with the microbes around them, remove most of the phosphorus and sequester carbon, which is key to reducing carbon emissions. </p>

    <p>Biologists from the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) carefully plant and manage these wetlands. In spring 2025, they started planting the 6,500-acre STA next to the EAA  Reservoir. In addition to the plants, this new ecosystem is already attracting wading birds and alligators. As the southern direction of water is re-established, the Everglades will once again provide a final filter before water reaches Miami.</p>

    <h1 class="title">Cleaner coasts</h1>
    <p class="subhead">Sending water south will reduce harmful discharges to Florida’s east and west coasts by 55 percent, minimizing the crippling effects of toxic algae blooms.</p>
    <p>Today, nutrient-rich, polluted waters from Lake Okeechobee are released to Florida's east and west coasts. While these discharges prevent flooding, they also fuel harmful algae blooms. The two major forms: red tide and toxic blue-green algae can cause respiratory symptoms and kill wildlife. As Florida has gotten hotter, nutrient runoff has increased and hurricanes have intensified, discharge-related toxic algae blooms have worsened. Since 2013, Florida’s coastal communities, especially Stuart, Fort Myers, Naples and Sanibel Island, have been hardest hit. </p>
    <p>South Florida draws anglers worldwide for its tarpon fishing and warm waters. Captain Daniel Andrews, a Fort Myers charter captain and co-founder of Captains for Clean Water, witnessed algae-driven fish die-offs devastate his business and community. </p>
    <p>“I had clients who’d fished here for 30, 40 years telling me, ‘We’re thinking of selling our homes. The water’s getting too bad,’” he says. </p>
    <p>The damage lingers. Harmful blooms spiked in 2013, 2016 and 2018, preventing ecosystems from rebounding. </p>
    <p>“Snook, redfish and tarpon populations are still struggling from the last major red tide bloom in 2018,” Andrews says. “What kills us is when the fish and the economy can’t recover. Eliminating even a few events is a big win.”</p>
    <p>The 2018 outbreak alone cost Florida’s tourism sector $184 million, according to a 2022 University of Florida study. Another outbreak similar to the 2018 events would be a multi-billion-dollar disaster, according to a 2024 economic study from a coalition of Southwest Florida environmental groups, including Captains for Clean Water.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>“Looking at all the components of the Everglades Restoration plan, the EAA Reservoir will have the single biggest impact as far as discharge reduction.”</p>
      <p class="cite">Captain Daniel Andrews, co-founder of Captains for Clean Water</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>These algae blooms won’t disappear entirely. Red tide and blue-green algae outbreaks have multiple causes, including natural ones like calm seas and sunlight. But reducing discharges will decrease the frequency and severity of the outbreaks. </p>
    <p>Yet Andrews is already starting to see the benefits of Everglades restoration. </p>
    <p>“The Army Corps is prioritizing reducing discharges,” he says.</p>

    <h1 class="title">Restoring the River of Grass</h1>
    <p class="subhead">The Everglades can revitalize natural tree islands and better endure dry seasons with the EAA reservoir’s added water storage. </p>
    <p>The historic changes in water flow and fire patterns have taken a toll on the natural construction of the Everglades. Previously, slow-moving water sculpted the Everglades’ limestone foundation, creating raised ridges of peat and sawgrass interspersed with deep-water sloughs. Over time, sediment built up on some ridges, forming tree islands — small forested patches of cypress, sweet bays, or willow that shelter diverse wildlife and hold deep cultural significance for the Seminole and Miccosukee tribes. Since 1940, more than 70 percent of tree island land cover has disappeared.</p>
    <p>With fewer natural tree islands, and as Florida’s climate grows hotter and drier, the Everglades’ dry season arrives too early, stranding fish and forcing wading birds to abandon their chicks. Alligators also struggle to find food. The EAA reservoir will help reverse these trends by storing water during the wet season and releasing it when needed most. </p>
    <p>“Dense, overdrained sawgrass stands will begin breaking into more regularly patterned ridges and sloughs,” says Davis. “Tree islands take thousands of years to develop, so degraded ones may not come back within our lifetime — but those still somewhat intact will see improved conditions.”</p>

    <h1 class="title">Protecting Florida Bay</h1>
    <p class="subhead">Wildlife and the fishing industry will benefit when more clean water moves south  into the Florida Bay.</p>
    <p>The Florida Bay, a rich estuary of seagrasses, mangroves and reefs at the southern tip of the peninsula, serves as a top fishing destination and a winter refuge for tarpon. But without enough freshwater, Florida Bay’s salinity can be double that of seawater. When salt levels rise too high, seagrasses die, along with the fish and manatees that rely on them. The reservoir would ensure enough fresh water reaches Florida Bay.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>“The EAA Reservoir is drought insurance for the Everglades and Florida Bay.”</p>
      <p class="cite">Dr. Steve Davis, Chief Science Officer at The Everglades Foundation</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In 2016, one of the worst die-offs wiped out over 40,000 acres of seagrass. </p>
    <p>“Florida Bay was known for clear water,” says Andrews. “But all that dead grass rotted, releasing nitrogen and triggering horrible cycles of algae blooms and muddy water.” </p>
    <p>The murky conditions blocked sunlight, slowing seagrass regrowth. </p>
    <p>“The very water that’s destroying us is so desperately needed down there,” says Andrews. “The EAA reservoir is a critical missing link.”</p>

    <p class="subhead">Florida residents and visitors will have more places to hike, kayak and hunt within the reservoir area.</p>
    <p>Everglades restoration projects balance ecological health with public access, allowing local communities to help shape their design. Potential amenities include hiking and biking trails, bird observation decks, kayak launches, picnic areas, fishing spots and hunting zones.</p>
    <p>Kayakers may explore the reservoir itself, while the nearby stormwater treatment wetland will attract abundant wildlife. </p>
    <p>“The treatment wetlands are internationally recognized hotspots for duck hunting,” says Davis. </p>
    <p>Visitors might spot snail kites hunting over the wetlands or alligators sunning along the shore. Wading birds like wood storks and roseate spoonbills have already started flocking to similar areas, making restoration a win for both ecology and recreation.</p>

    <h1 class="title">Constructing the future</h1>
    <p class="subhead">While the EAA Reservoir project has made significant progress, continued funding and support are critical.</p>
    <p>Construction of the EAA reservoir began in 2021, but restoring a system as vast and interconnected as the Everglades takes time. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) ranks among the largest ecosystem restoration efforts in the world, spanning millions of acres, impacting millions of people and requiring billions of dollars. The EAA reservoir is one of its most significant projects.</p>
    <p>“It's not like you can just pull these things off a shelf at a home improvement store and install them,” says Bell. “It takes a lot of engineering, time and financial support from both federal and non-federal sponsors.”</p>
    <p>Reservoir construction is set to finish in 2029, with the embankment wall completed in 2034. Good to add information about jobs created here. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>“We've been waiting 25 years for the EAA Reservoir.”</p>
      <p class="cite">Eric Eikenberg, CEO of the Everglades Foundation</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>“Fish kills, job losses — crises like these have driven demand for change on both coasts,” says Eikenberg. “This long-planned project is finally fixing the problem by redirecting water south. But we can’t finish the job without this reservoir. Every year, we have to push Congress and the White House to fully fund Everglades restoration.” </p>
    <p>Bringing the reservoir online will happen in phases, Bell explains, with extensive modeling to evaluate how it affects the entire Lake Okeechobee system. The stakes are high — delays mean more algae blooms, worsening droughts and floods, plus further stress on the Biscayne Aquifer. </p>
    <p>In 2028, the Army Corps will begin drafting its next plan for managing lake flows with the reservoir in place — an opportunity, Bell emphasizes, for the public to shape the future of South Florida’s water.</p>

    <h1 class="title">Going with the flow</h1>
    <p class="subhead">In the 20th century, Floridians tried to bend nature to their will. The EAA reservoir is a response to a simple truth: it’s better to work with nature than against it. </p>
    <p>Whether it's sipping a cafecito on a breezy Miami patio, skimming across the River of Grass on an airboat or wrestling a silver tarpon in Florida Bay, water shapes life in South Florida.</p>
    <p>Yet the impact of Everglades restoration extends beyond the coasts or the marshes, as Florida’s water-based tourism economy contributed almost $37 billion in state, local and federal taxes.</p>
    <p>Protecting Florida’s clean water economy, and the delicate ecosystem that fuels it, requires ongoing investment. The EAA  reservoir and other key Everglades restoration projects, including the C-43 Reservoir west of Lake Okeechobee, the Picayune Strand Restoration Project, and the long-overdue effort to raise the Tamiami Trail are all key components. </p>
    <p>“Once all these pieces are in place, we’ll be able to see the big picture and recognize real progress,” says Bell. </p>
    <p>Each project plays a role in improving water management, working together to restore the Everglades step by step. Managing South Florida’s water is a vast, ever-evolving challenge. </p>
    <p>“Every part of Everglades restoration—even a small project like a pump station—fits into a larger solution,” Bell explains. “The biggest puzzle piece we have is the EAA reservoir, and once it’s complete, all these puzzle pieces will fall into place, bringing the Everglades back to life.”</p>
    <p>That final picture is coming into focus — an Everglades restored, resilient and thriving once again.</p>
